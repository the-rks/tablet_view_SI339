                    Jojo is a 14 year old dog that has grown up with me. He’s a Lhasa-Apso which is a breed from Tibet that’s known to be a watchdog. Funny enough, Jojo acts exactly like a watchdog. He likes to spend his days sitting next to a window looking and barking at people passing by. He is only a watchdog though, as he gets scared very easily.
                </p>
                <p>
                    His favorite thing in life is food and his favorite foods are sweet potatoes and naan. He loves walks as well, however he will not go outside if it’s raining or if there’s a lot of snow on the ground. He’s taken some old blankets and pillows we had to make his own bed. He’s also trilingual, able to understand English, Hindi, and Japanese.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Millie is an English Cream goldendoodle but sometimes is described as a human in a dog suit. She loves cuddles and can speak if you tell her to. She always wants to be around people and lays in bed on her back like a person. 

                </p>
                <p>
                    Millie is eager to go on walks and runs but is very out of shape. When we get to the final hill of each run she is way behind, she will nap for hours a day but then bounces up and down if she sees bunnies or squirrels.

                    River is a 7 year old bichon frise. Though he is aging, he is extremely active and loves to play. He likes to throw things. He will throw his ball down the stairs and play fetch with himself if you don’t give him attention. He will also throw his food and water bowl to let us know he wants more.            
                </p>
                <p>
                    River is obsessed with my mom. My mom is the one who mostly walks him and gives him treats. Anywhere my mom goes, River follows. If she's gone for 2 minutes, he will frantically search the house for her. Although he likes being with people, he hates being cuddled or held.

                    One of my earliest memories was spending time with a newly born Subin, So in a way, we grew up together. Therefore, from going to the store at the end of the road to eating together, we did everything together.

                <p>
                    Subin was somehow not bothered by vaccum cleaners. Even though the loudness of it was able to scare any animals away, Subin enjoyed the chaos of it, opting to even sit on the handle as we vaccum.

                    Cheeto is a cat who likes to eat a lot and play a lot. He has an obsession with his grandpa (human) and tries to get outside every single day. If he isn’t causing problems, he is usually hiding in a seven foot tall cat tree and sleeping.

                    Another name for Cheeto is Chicken, because sometimes he sits very scrunched up and ends up looking like a rotisserie chicken. He was nicknamed this by one of his friends, and now he understands it as his own name. He is about six years old and still acts like a younger cat, despite being middle-aged.

                    He does not like any toys anymore as when he was younger, he watched a bigger toy shred his favorite one to pieces. He used to know how to roll over, but now replaced that memory with a spin as it is much easier.
